# FraudStream
FraudStream processes banking transaction data from CSV files, streams it through Kafka, and uses predictive models to detect fraud. Suspicious transactions are stored in a PostgreSQL database, with Grafana used for real-time data visualization, allowing stakeholders to monitor trends and enhance fraud detection capabilities.
